## Design and Architecture Decisions

### 1. RAG Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a custom RAG pipeline without using LangChain or other high-level frameworks.

**Rationale**:
- **Educational Value**: Building from first principles provides deeper understanding of RAG components
- **Simplicity**: Reduces dependency complexity and makes debugging easier
- **Customization**: Full control over retrieval strategy, prompt engineering, and response generation
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into each component's behavior for evaluation

**Implementation**:
- Document chunking with configurable chunk size (500 tokens) and overlap (50 tokens)
- Semantic search using ChromaDB vector database
- Top-k retrieval (k=5) to balance context quality and cost
- Custom prompt templates with source attribution

### 2. Modular Component Design

**Decision**: Separate the system into independent, testable modules.

**Rationale**:
- **Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Modules can be used independently or combined
- **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific components

**Modules**:
- `DocumentProcessor`: Handles parsing and chunking of multiple document formats
- `EmbeddingModel`: Manages text-to-vector conversion
- `VectorStore`: Provides semantic search over document chunks
- `RAGPipeline`: Orchestrates retrieval and generation
- `Evaluator`: Measures system quality metrics

### 3. Vector Database Strategy

**Decision**: Use ChromaDB with local persistent storage.

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: No external database server required
- **Cost**: Free, no cloud database fees
- **Performance**: Fast local queries (<100ms for retrieval)
- **Portability**: Database persists in `chroma_db/` directory, easy to deploy
- **Development**: Quick iteration without managing infrastructure

**Trade-offs**:
- Limited to single-instance deployment (acceptable for MVP)
- Not suitable for high-scale concurrent access
- Database size limited by disk space (~50MB for 70 pages)

### 4. Embedding Model Selection

**Decision**: Use Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for local embeddings.

**Rationale**:
- **Cost**: Free, no API calls required
- **Speed**: Fast inference (~100ms for query embedding)
- **Quality**: 384-dimensional embeddings with good semantic capture
- **Privacy**: All embedding computation happens locally
- **Deployment**: No dependency on external embedding APIs

**Trade-offs**:
- Lower quality than OpenAI embeddings (1536 dimensions)
- Requires model download (~80MB) on first run
- CPU-based inference (GPU would be faster but adds complexity)

### 5. LLM Selection

**Decision**: Use OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo via OpenRouter API.

**Rationale**:
- **Cost**: Very affordable at ~$0.001 per question
- **Quality**: Excellent instruction-following and citation generation
- **Reliability**: Stable API with good uptime
- **Speed**: Fast response times (median 752ms)
- **Flexibility**: OpenRouter provides easy model switching for experimentation

**Alternative Considered**: Free models (DeepSeek, Llama via OpenRouter free tier)
- **Issue**: Rate limiting (429 errors) made free tier unsuitable for production
- **Decision**: $5 credit provides ~5000 questions, sufficient for MVP and evaluation

### 6. Guardrails Implementation

**Decision**: Implement prompt-based guardrails to refuse out-of-scope questions.

**Rationale**:
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback when questions are outside policy domain
- **Accuracy**: Prevents hallucination on unrelated topics
- **Compliance**: Ensures system stays within intended use case
- **Simplicity**: Implemented via prompt engineering, no additional models required

**Implementation**:
```
If the question is not related to TechCorp policies, politely decline and
explain that you can only answer questions about company policies.
```

### 7. Citation Strategy

**Decision**: Require LLM to cite source documents with specific quotes.

**Rationale**:
- **Verifiability**: Users can validate answers against source documents
- **Trust**: Explicit citations build confidence in responses
- **Accountability**: Easy to trace incorrect answers to source retrieval issues
- **Evaluation**: Enables automated citation accuracy metrics

**Implementation**:
- Prompt instructs LLM to include citations in format: `[Source: filename]`
- Retrieval provides top-5 most relevant chunks with metadata
- Citations evaluated by checking if referenced document was in retrieved context

### 8. Deployment Architecture

**Decision**: Deploy on Railway with automated CI/CD pipeline.

**Rationale**:
- **Cost**: Pay-as-you-go pricing (~$5/month for MVP usage)
- **Simplicity**: Automatic deployments from Git
- **Reliability**: Managed infrastructure with good uptime
- **Speed**: Fast cold starts and builds
- **CI/CD Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub Actions

**Pipeline Design**:
- Push to `develop` branch → CI tests run → Auto-merge to `main` → Railway deploys
- Ensures only tested code reaches production
- GitHub Actions provides automated testing (smoke tests, import validation)

## Evaluation Approach

### 1. Test Set Construction

**Approach**: Create a diverse test set covering all policy categories and edge cases.

**Test Set Composition**:
- **30 total questions** across 8 categories
- **28 in-scope questions** about company policies
- **2 out-of-scope questions** to test guardrails

**Category Distribution**:
| Category | Questions | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| PTO | 5 | Test vacation/time-off policy understanding |
| Remote Work | 5 | Test work-from-home policy comprehension |
| Expenses | 5 | Test reimbursement policy knowledge |
| Security | 4 | Test data security policy understanding |
| Benefits | 3 | Test employee benefits policy knowledge |
| Holidays | 3 | Test company holiday policy comprehension |
| Learning | 3 | Test professional development policy understanding |
| Out-of-scope | 2 | Test guardrails (non-policy questions) |

**Question Design Principles**:
- **Specificity**: Questions require retrieving specific policy details
- **Realism**: Questions mirror real user information needs
- **Diversity**: Cover different difficulty levels and policy sections
- **Edge Cases**: Include complex scenarios (e.g., partial remote work eligibility)

### 2. Evaluation Metrics

#### Groundedness (Primary Quality Metric)
**Definition**: Does the answer contain only information supported by retrieved documents?

**Measurement**:
- **Automated LLM-based evaluation** using GPT-3.5 Turbo as judge
- Prompt: "Is this answer fully grounded in the provided context?"
- Binary score: 1 (grounded) or 0 (hallucinated/unsupported)
- Threshold: >0.8 (80%) for acceptable quality

**Why This Metric**:
- Measures core RAG value: factual accuracy from documents
- Detects hallucination and speculation
- Critical for trust in policy Q&A system

#### Citation Accuracy (Secondary Quality Metric)
**Definition**: Do the cited sources actually support the answer?

**Measurement**:
- **Automated verification** by checking if cited documents were in retrieved context
- Binary score: 1 (citation present in context) or 0 (citation not found)
- Threshold: >0.8 (80%) for acceptable citation quality

**Why This Metric**:
- Ensures users can verify answers
- Detects prompt injection or citation fabrication
- Validates retrieval effectiveness

#### Latency (Performance Metric)
**Definition**: How long does the system take to answer a question?

**Measurement**:
- **End-to-end latency**: Time from question submission to answer delivery
- Metrics: p50 (median), p95 (95th percentile), mean, min, max
- Acceptable threshold: p95 < 3 seconds

**Why This Metric**:
- User experience requirement for interactive chatbot
- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Validates deployment infrastructure

### 3. Evaluation Implementation

**Automated Pipeline**:
```python
# Run evaluation on test set
python evaluate_rag.py

# Outputs:
# - evaluation_results/metrics.json (summary statistics)

```

**Evaluation Components**:
1. **Question Processing**: Load test set from `evaluation/test_set.json`
2. **RAG Execution**: Generate answers using production RAG pipeline
3. **Groundedness Evaluation**: LLM judges answer vs. retrieved context
4. **Citation Verification**: Check if citations match retrieved documents
5. **Latency Measurement**: Record end-to-end response time
6. **Aggregation**: Compute mean, median, percentiles, category breakdowns
