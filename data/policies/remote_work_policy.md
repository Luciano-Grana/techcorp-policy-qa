## Eligibility

Remote work is available to employees who:
- Have completed their probationary period (90 days)
- Have received satisfactory or above performance ratings
- Have a role suitable for remote work as determined by their manager
- Have a suitable home workspace with reliable internet (minimum 25 Mbps)

## Remote Work Arrangements

### Fully Remote
Employees may work remotely full-time with manager approval. Fully remote employees must:
- Be available during core business hours (10 AM - 3 PM local time)
- Attend in-person meetings quarterly or as business needs require
- Maintain a dedicated workspace

### Hybrid Schedule
Employees may work remotely up to 3 days per week. Teams must coordinate to ensure adequate in-office coverage.

### Ad-hoc Remote Work
Occasional remote work days are permitted with manager notification (no formal approval needed for up to 2 days per month).

## Equipment and Technology

## Communication Expectations

Remote employees must:
- Keep their calendar updated and accurate
- Respond to messages within 2 hours during business hours

## Performance and Accountability

Remote work is a privilege, not a right. Managers will evaluate remote arrangements quarterly based on:

- Overall performance

## Security Requirements
