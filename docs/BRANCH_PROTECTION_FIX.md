# Branch Protection - Allow Direct Push for Solo Projects

## The Situation

Branch protection is working correctly! But it's blocking direct pushes to `main`.

Error you're seeing:
```
Required status check "build-and-test" is expected.
push declined due to repository rule violations
```

This is **correct behavior** for team projects, but might be too strict for solo academic projects.

## The Fix: Allow Admin Bypass

For solo projects, you can keep the protection but allow yourself to push directly:

### Steps:

1. **Go to Branch Settings**:
   https://github.com/Luciano-Grana/techcorp-policy-qa/settings/branches

2. **Click "Edit"** on your `main` branch rule

3. **Scroll to bottom** and find these settings:

4. **UNCHECK** (disable) this option:
   - ❌ **"Do not allow bypassing the above settings"**

   This allows repository admins (you) to push directly while still keeping the rule for others.

5. **Save changes**

### Alternative: Disable Branch Protection Entirely

If you want full freedom to push:

1. Go to branch settings (same link above)
2. Click "Edit" on `main` branch rule
3. Scroll to bottom
4. Click **"Delete rule"**

**Note**: Railway will still work with "Wait for CI" even without branch protection!

## What This Accomplishes

**With admin bypass enabled**:
- ✅ You can push directly to `main`
- ✅ CI still runs on every push
- ✅ Railway still waits for CI to pass
- ✅ Required checks are still tracked
- ✅ No need for Pull Requests

**With branch protection deleted**:
- ✅ Full freedom to push
- ✅ CI still runs
- ✅ Railway still waits (if configured in Railway settings)
- ⚠️ No GitHub-enforced checks

## Recommended: Admin Bypass

For your academic project, **enable admin bypass** instead of deleting the rule.

**Why**:
- Keeps the professional CI/CD setup
- Shows best practices in your portfolio
- Railway respects the required check
- But doesn't block your development workflow

## After Making Changes

Try pushing again:

```bash
git push
```

Should now work! Railway will:
1. See the push
2. Wait for `build-and-test` check
3. Deploy when check passes

## For Reference: Full PR Workflow (Alternative)

If you want to keep strict protection, use branches:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-change

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "My change"

# Push feature branch (not protected)
git push -u origin feature/my-change

# On GitHub:
# - Create Pull Request
# - Wait for CI
# - Merge when green
```

But for a solo academic project, this adds unnecessary complexity.
