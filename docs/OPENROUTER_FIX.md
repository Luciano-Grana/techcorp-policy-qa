# OpenRouter Error Fix - RESOLVED âœ…

## Error You Were Seeing

```
An error occurred while generating the answer: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

## What Was Wrong

Two issues:
1. **Old OpenAI SDK** (v1.6.1) incompatible with OpenRouter
2. **Wrong model name format** (had `:free` suffix which OpenRouter doesn't recognize)

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Upgraded OpenAI SDK
```bash
# Before
openai==1.6.1

# After
openai>=2.0.0  (installed 2.6.1)
```

### 2. Updated rag_pipeline.py

**Before** (old SDK style):
```python
import openai
openai.api_key = key
openai.api_base = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
response = openai.chat.completions.create(...)
```

**After** (new SDK style):
```python
from openai import OpenAI
self.client = OpenAI(
    api_key=key,
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
)
response = self.client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

### 3. Fixed Model Name in .env

**Before**:
```bash
LLM_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free
```

**After**:
```bash
LLM_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct
```

OpenRouter doesn't use the `:free` suffix in API calls - it determines free vs paid based on your API key.

## Test Results âœ…

```
Question: How much PTO do employees get?

Answer:
Employees accrue up to 1.5 times their annual PTO allotment, but
the specific amount of PTO varies based on years of service.

According to Document 3, Accrual Rates, the accrual rates are:
* 0-2 years: 15 days per year (1.25 days per month)
* 3-5 years: 20 days per year (1.67 days per month)
* 6+ years: 25 days per year (2.08 days per month)

âœ… Working perfectly!
```

## What You Need to Do

### If Running in Global Python (deactivate venv):

Already done! Just restart your app:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

### If Running in Virtual Environment:

You need to upgrade the OpenAI package in your venv:

```bash
# Activate venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade OpenAI
pip install --upgrade openai

# Run app
python app.py
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/rag_pipeline.py** - Updated to use new OpenAI SDK
2. **.env** - Fixed model name (removed `:free`)
3. **requirements.txt** - Updated `openai==1.6.1` to `openai>=2.0.0`

## Verification

Test that it's working:

```bash
# Start the app
python3 app.py

# Open browser
http://localhost:5000

# Ask: "How much PTO do employees get?"
# Should get a detailed answer with citations!
```

## Why This Happened

The OpenAI Python SDK had a major version update (v1 â†’ v2) that changed how you initialize clients. The old way (`openai.api_base = ...`) doesn't work anymore. The new way uses a client instance with `base_url` parameter.

## Current Working Configuration

```
âœ“ OpenRouter API Key: Configured
âœ“ Model: meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct
âœ“ OpenAI SDK: 2.6.1
âœ“ Vector Store: 125 documents indexed
âœ“ Status: WORKING âœ…
```

## Summary

**Problem**: SDK compatibility issue with OpenRouter
**Solution**: Upgraded OpenAI SDK + Fixed model name
**Result**: Chatbot now works perfectly with OpenRouter!

---

**Next**: Run `python3 app.py` and start chatting! ðŸš€
